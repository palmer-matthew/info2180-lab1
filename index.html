                This is a simple paragraph about me. I am a second year Computing student majoring in Computer Science.
                I am interesed in alot of things as my interests invlove music, coding , reading and gaining knowledge plus more.
                I do not know which area of Computing I would like to focus in so for now I am just trying to get experience in various
                aspects of Computing.
